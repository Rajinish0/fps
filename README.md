A starting point for a FPS game idea I had, maze generation is done using the classic back tracking algo. The gun shoots a ray and basic ray tracing is done to see what object it hits.

TO DO:
   - The ray intersection needs to be extended to more objects.
   -  A better maze.
   -  Better visuals.
   -  The gun is just displayed infront of the camera rn, it would be good to have some sort of an animation
